This was a real challenge. Over the past few months I have continued to learn and learn and learn. When it was time to create something, I couldn't find my creative side. It felt like I could only retain information and execute the next lab. In order for me to switch gears I explained my project to a couple of my close friends to get the wheels turning. They pitched lots of ideas, even the ridiculous ideas had me thinking. 

I believe that my creative side has taken a vacation and it's due to the fact that coding is scary to me. It's new, its foregin, I've never done it before. I have a lot riding on this education, new career, next chapter of a relationship and even possibly starting a family. Thinking about how much I have to get done in order to go to this next step in my life is overwhelming. I can't turnback now, I'm too far in. 


I joined a CLI study group last week and the instructor told us "make something you're proud of, write good code and take it a step at a time". So that's what I have done. I designed a gem that shows you the weather for today and tomorrow in Brooklyn. It's not extravagant but it's useful and I'm proud of it.
