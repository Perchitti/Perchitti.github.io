Final projects are always a tough one for me. I am retaining so much information within Learn.co, that when it's time for me to produce I feel lost. This one has been a very challenging project. Sinatra has never felt natural for me. Although it does make sense to me now, I wil be extremely happy when this particular area of my learning is complete. 

My project, Collbarating Sentences, is a site that allows users to make a story together. Each user places a sentence in the story one at a time. Another user then uses that first sentence to create the direction the second sentence will go. 


Example: 
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/x11KlP8"><a href="//imgur.com/x11KlP8"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


I can honestly say, this is not the most creative idea I have had, but I am proud of the way it works and interacts with the user. I am looking foward to reviewing this with a professor and learning even more about Sinatra.
