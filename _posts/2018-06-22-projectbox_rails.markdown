ProjectBox is built for artists to store their projects within the site. The User (artists) are currently able to add the working title that is in progress. I am hoping to add photos to this project once I learn JS. The user can access all aspects of their projects, create, edit and delete. A user is not able to see other users information or projects, they can only see their own projects. 

There are validations throughout the project such as presence, password_confirmation, and others. The validations throughout the project allow projects to stay private. This is something that is very important to most artists, filmmakers, typically there is a "working title" then the project comes to completion, that when they usually release a final title. Within ProjectBox users are able to update endlessly while maintaing the proper url that was instantiated upon creation. 

Looking forward to making this appealing to the artist eye once I learn JS.
