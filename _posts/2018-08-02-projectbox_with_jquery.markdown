I recently finished the rails with jQuery project. I decided to take my Rails portfolio project and add the jQuery to it, plus other features. The original ProjectBox wasn't very exciting, you could only store a project title and associate a user & location to that particular project. 

Now in ProjectBox 2.0, it is a website for the creatives to collaborate on projects together and keep track of what items may be needed for that project. The jQuery I added to this ..

1. A "more" button on the projects index page that expands information about the project. 

2. A "next" button on the projects show page that conitnues to show each project without switching the page. 

3. A form was added to the projects show page where the user can add equipment associated to each project. The form uses jQuery to show the item without switching pages. This is also where I included a has_many item within the project that utilizes jQuery. 
*(A project has many items).


I enjoyed this project. It helped me bring to life the original vision I had for ProjectBox when I started it in the Rails Portfolio Project. jQuery is still a challenge to me, I hope to continue to build on this knowledge in the future.
